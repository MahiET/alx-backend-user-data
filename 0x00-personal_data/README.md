What is PII, non-PII, and personal data?
=

Personally identifiable information (PII) and personal data are two classifications of data that often cause confusion for organizations that collect, store and analyze such data.

<h2>What is personally identifiable information (PII)</h2>

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

<h2>What is non-PII</h2>

Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is data that cannot be used on its own to trace, or identify a person.Examples of non-PII include, but are not limited to:

* Aggregated statistics on the use of product / service

* Partially or fully masked IP addresses

However, the classification of PII and non-PII is vague. Moreover, NIST doesn’t referencecookie IDs and device IDs, so many AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers consider them as non-PII. As we’ll see, this is in contrast to the definition of personal data, which treats such digital tackers as information that could identify an individual.


<h2>What is personal data?</h2>

           personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable           natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can           be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identi           fier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identi           fier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, geneti           c, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;
